# Changing default indentation to 2 spaces in VS Code
## What is achieved
By making a simple setting change in VS Code you can make pylint recognise 2 spaces as valid indentation on all your local repositories.

## The method
1. Open the extensions marketplace (icon of four squares in the left-hand toolbar) and search for pylint.
2. When you have a list of matching extensions, click on the cog icon (lower-left corner) in the pylint pane.
3. This should open the configuration menu, as shown. From this menu click on **'Extension Settings'**

4. This should open the user settings for the pylint extension. Look for the entry labeled **"Pylint: Args"** (as shown).

5. In the entry box type:
indent-string='  '
Be sure to use **SINGLE** quotes and, to put **TWO** spaces between the quotes.
6. Then click 'OK'

That's it. From here you should no longer see errors about bad identation being generated by pylint as pylint is now instructed to use two spaces for indentation rather than four.
